# Claude Code instructions for Agentbook

Before working in any directory, always read the `AGENTS.md` file located in that directory (if one exists) for directory-specific conventions and constraints.

Key `AGENTS.md` locations in this repository:

- `/AGENTS.md` – top-level contributor notes (link checker usage, CI info).
- `.github/workflows/AGENTS.md` – workflow authoring rules, label lifecycle, and the prohibition on editing `*.lock.yml` files by hand.
