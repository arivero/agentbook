            ## Instructions

            - Read issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} and comments.
            - If `triaged-for-research` is not present, exit with no action.
            - Produce a short research comment with sources and implementation implications.
            - Add label `researched-waiting-opinions`.
            - If the issue should be declined after research:
              - explain why,
              - add `rejected`,
              - close the issue.
