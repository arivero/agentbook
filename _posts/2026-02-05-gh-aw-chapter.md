title: "New Section: GitHub Agentic Workflows"

We just added a new section on **GitHub Agentic Workflows (GH-AW)**, the emerging approach that turns markdown instructions into secure, composable GitHub Actions powered by AI agents.

## What’s New in the Book

The new section explains:

- How GH-AW workflows are structured (frontmatter + markdown)
- Why compilation to `.lock.yml` matters for reproducibility
- How tools, safe inputs, and safe outputs keep automation secure
- How imports and shared components enable reusable workflow building blocks
- The ResearchPlanAssign pattern for continuous, human-guided improvement

## Operational Playbook

Alongside the chapter, we added an **Agentic Workflow Playbook** for this repo that documents a research → plan → assign loop. It makes it easier to:

1. Discover new libraries or scaffolds
2. Debate proposals in issues
3. Assign agents to implement accepted updates
4. Keep the book and blog synchronized

## Read the Section

Start with **GitHub Agentic Workflows (GH-AW)** and follow the playbook to see how the book maintains itself in practice.

*This update follows our self-maintaining workflow: research, consensus, implementation, and publication.*
