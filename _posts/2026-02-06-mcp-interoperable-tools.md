title: "MCP: Interoperable Tools for Agents"
date: 2026-02-06
---

We just expanded **Chapter 4: Skills and Tools Management** with a new section on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and how it shapes modern agent tooling.

## Why This Matters

MCP has shifted from an emerging idea to a **shared tool interoperability layer**. Instead of wiring every assistant to every system, teams define tools once in MCP servers and let multiple clients discover and use them safely.

## What the New Section Covers

- How MCP enables portable tool definitions and safer execution
- Common usage patterns (server catalogs, context stitching, permission-first workflows)
- Adoption notes for **Codex**, **GitHub Copilot**, and **Claude**
- Practical guidance for documenting and versioning MCP tool contracts

## Read the Update

Head to **Chapter 4** to read the new MCP section and see how it fits into tool design, discovery, and best practices.

*As always, this update reflects the book's self-maintaining workflow: observe industry shifts, capture them clearly, and publish concise guidance.*
