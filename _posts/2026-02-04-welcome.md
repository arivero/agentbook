Welcome to the **Agentic Workflows Book** - a living, self-maintaining guide to building with AI agents!

## What Makes This Book Different?

This isn't just another technical book. It's a **living experiment** that demonstrates the very concepts it teaches. The book uses agentic workflows to maintain and update itself based on community input.

## The Vision

We're building a comprehensive resource that covers:

1. **Agentic Workflows**: How to leverage AI agents for automation
2. **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinating multiple agents effectively
3. **Agentic Scaffolding**: Building infrastructure for agent-driven systems
4. **Skills and Tools**: Creating and managing agent capabilities

## How It Works

The book implements a complete self-maintenance system:

- 📝 **Community Input**: Anyone can suggest improvements via GitHub issues
- 🤖 **Automated Processing**: Workflows analyze suggestions and determine relevance
- ✍️ **AI Writing**: Agents update content based on approved suggestions
- 📚 **Auto-Publishing**: Changes are automatically built and deployed
- 📰 **Blog Updates**: This blog announces significant updates

## Get Involved

This is a community-driven project. Here's how you can participate:

- **Read and Learn**: Explore the chapters and learn about agentic workflows
- **Suggest Improvements**: Open issues with ideas for new content or improvements
- **Share Experiences**: Tell us about your own experiences with agent-based systems
- **Watch It Evolve**: See how the book updates itself over time

## What's Next?

We're just getting started! The initial content covers the fundamentals, but the book will grow based on community needs and emerging patterns in the field.

Follow along as we build something truly unique - a book that practices what it preaches by maintaining itself through agentic workflows.
