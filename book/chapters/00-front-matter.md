# Preface {-}

This book is for engineering leaders, platform teams, and practitioners who want to build reliable agentic workflows in real software systems. We focus on practical architecture, safe operations, and buildable examples rather than hype or speculative design.

You should be comfortable with Git, GitHub Actions, and basic software engineering practices. We assume familiarity with automation tools and CI/CD concepts.

# Conventions Used in This Book {-}

- **Inline code** is shown in a monospaced font.
- **File names** appear above code blocks (Example 4-2, etc.).
- **Commands** use fenced code blocks with a language tag.
- **Code samples** are illustrative pseudocode unless explicitly labeled “Runnable.”
- **Tip**, **Note**, and **Warning** callouts highlight critical guidance.

> **Tip:** Prefer pinned action SHAs in CI workflows that handle secrets.

> **Warning:** Always review agent-generated changes before merge, especially when credentials or production systems are involved.
