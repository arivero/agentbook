# Agentic Workflows: A Practical Guide

## About This Book

This book is a living document that explores the fascinating world of agentic workflows, agent orchestration, and agentic scaffolding. It demonstrates modern AI-powered development practices by being self-maintaining—the book updates itself based on community suggestions and contributions through automated workflows.

## What You'll Learn

This book covers four core areas that together form the foundation for building practical agentic systems.

The first area is **Agentic Workflows**, where you will learn how AI agents can automate complex tasks that would otherwise require explicit, step-by-step programming. Rather than scripting every decision, agentic workflows allow you to define goals and let agents determine the best path to achieve them.

The second area is **Agent Orchestration**, which addresses how to coordinate multiple agents so they work together effectively. You will learn patterns for sequencing, parallelising, and supervising agents to handle tasks that exceed what any single agent can accomplish alone.

The third area is **Agentic Scaffolding**, which concerns the infrastructure that makes agent-driven development reliable. This includes execution environments, communication protocols, resource management, and the observability tooling needed to debug and improve agent behaviour over time.

The fourth area is **Skills and Tools**, covering how to use, import, and compose agent capabilities. You will learn how tools provide atomic actions, how skills bundle tools into reusable workflows, and how modern standards like MCP and AGENTS.md help agents discover and use these capabilities safely.

## Structure

The manuscript lives in `book/chapters/` and is assembled into the HTML and PDF outputs during the build.
